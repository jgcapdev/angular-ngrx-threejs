## âœ¨ How to install

Simply run `git clone` and then `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

## ðŸ”§ Project scaffolding

Inside `app` folder there are several new directories as you can see in the following scaffolding.

.
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ models
â”œâ”€â”€ state
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ actions
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ reducers
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ selectors
â””â”€â”€ ...

## ðŸ”¥ Install dependencies

- Install Angular Three with `npm install --save-dev @angular-three/schematics ` and `npx nx generate @angular-three/schematics:init`
- Install NGRX with `nnpm install @ngrx/store --save`.
- Install NgRx DevToos with `npm install @ngrx/store-devtools --save --legacy-peer-deps` and add

```js
StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({
      maxAge: 25,
      logOnly: environment.production,
    }),
```

into the `app.modulle.ts`. Then, you need add a Chrome extension called [Redux devtoos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=es) in order to add a new tab in _Developer tools_ of Chrone.

If you need to install another Angular Three dependency (for example Soba) add it with `npm i @angular-three/soba --legacy-peer-deps`.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The project is deployed on **Netlify**. We had some troubles during deployment, for example, we added an **environment variable** called `NPM_FLAGS` with `--legacy-peer-deps`.
