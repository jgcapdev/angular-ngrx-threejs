## âœ¨ How to install

Simply run `git clone` and then `npm install`.

## ðŸš€ Netlify

The project is deployed on **Netlify**.

- Install Angular Three with `npm install --save-dev @angular-three/schematics ` and `npx nx generate @angular-three/schematics:init`
- Install NGRX with `nnpm install @ngrx/store --save`.
- If there is any error during the deployment process in Netlify use an **environment variable** called `NPM_FLAGS` with `--legacy-peer-deps`.

If you need to install another Angular Three dependency (for example Soba) add it with `npm i @angular-three/soba --legacy-peer-deps`.
